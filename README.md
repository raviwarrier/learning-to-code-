# Learning to Code

All these are small projects that I have created following instructions from various courses on Udemy.

I used to be a coder before 2005 and the tech has changed so much that I just feel intrigued to learn it again.

Also, you might find all of this code useless, but feel free to ping me or use the code however you wish.
